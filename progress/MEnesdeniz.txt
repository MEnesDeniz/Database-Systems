31.11.2021 Because of the some project constraints I have to switch my team, I have completed some steps in that team that could be avaiable and seen by my former team repo.
08.11.2021 After starting project from stracth I have selected suitable dataset for my project. Work on the create database table schemas and found the necessary tables for satisyfing the conditions. After that I have setup my database and connect it to my project. Moreover I have created a layout html which I will use to generate other pages in the upcoming days. I have finished the project substructure and enviromental necessities. From now on I will create the necessary pages and functionalities.

15.11.2021 I have two branches one for development and the other one for main branch. In start I thought that I would develop and later test the features than pull them to the main
but after started the development process I realized that using another branch for development is not necessarily beneficial for me and also after checking the
project instructions again the emphasis on commit style had come reasonable for me. I have created new pages(airlines,airports,flights) and and extended layout.html. 
Also, using pgadmin4 I have populated some data to my database need write SQL queries on them ,mainly insert,. So to ensure POST method everything is nearly done. To ease the
process of writing code I have also implemented blueprint to my structure.
